Fucntions:

The translation functions will have some degree of fuzzy-searching and use the
OPD (possibly more?)
!oji : English word -> Ojibwe word

Bot auto-reacts with numbers that users can press to open links, ie.
> anishinaabemowin /anishinaabemowin-/: /ANISHINAABEMO-/ stem of ANISHINAABEMO Vai ; /-WIN/ [noun forming final]
assuming the all-caps words are links, a user could press the [1] reaction to
also get the definition of ANISHINAABEMO- or [2] for ANISHINAABEMO, etc.
